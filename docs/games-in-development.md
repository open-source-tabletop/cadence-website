!!! warning

    The following games are actively being developed, they may be playable but require additional material and testing.

## [Halo: Breakpoint](halo-breakpoint/introduction.md)

Halo: Breakpoint is a fan made game module set in the Halo universe that allows you to enact battles from any era in the Halo timeline using 28mm miniatures. As there are no official miniatures in this scale you will need to find suitable proxies, or fan made sculpts to use.

## [Survivors](survivors/introduction.md)

It's the Zombie Apocalypse and your only goal now is to survive! You and your small band of survivors must scavenge food, meds, and ammo amongst the wreckage of civilization, but the walking dead are not the only threat you need to be contend with. You are not the only survivors and competition is ruthless, they will stop at nothing to get those supplies before you, and there's definitely not enough to go around.
