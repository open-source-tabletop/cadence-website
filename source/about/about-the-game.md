# About the Game

---

Cadence is a set of wargaming rules: describing how you would move and attack with models on the tabletop. However, it is how these rules are utilised to make unique games, and how these rules are developed and licensed, that makes Cadence what it is.

### Simple and Fun Core Rules

The core rules of Cadence are simple and quick to learn, with a dynamic flow of actions, and enough depth for experienced gamers. It is a D6 system with alternating activations that streamlines most of the traditional elements of tabletop wargames. This allows the core rules to be fun and light while game modules, expansions created for the system, can implement only those new rules that provide thematic or tactical depth.

### Game Modules

Game Modules are how you play Cadence. Each module is its own unique game, providing army lists to choose your models from, custom rules for that setting, missions, stories and almost anything else you might need.

There are [several games available](../released-games.md) for you to try, some light and some more in-depth. Beyond that we encourage players and designers to get involved, to help us expand our modules, to balance and modify them, and to create new ones. And if you have a game you want to create you can even use the Cadence system thanks to it's permissive license.
