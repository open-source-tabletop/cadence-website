### Devil's Bluff

- Gang Balances:
  - Reduced 'Leader' Command attribute from 6 to 5
  - Aces Wild now restricted to one per gang.
- Rules Changes:
  - Removed the ability to play sets or runs from your hand. Adds complexity and almost never comes up.
  - Clarified objectives: they now require a Skill Draw rather than a fixed value.
- Missions:
  - Changed mission 1 to 'Gold Rush', balanced objective placement and clarified how objectives are scored if one gang routs.
  - Balanced mission 2 "Run them out of town", increasing the points for the central control objective and adding secondary objectives near your opponents entry points.
